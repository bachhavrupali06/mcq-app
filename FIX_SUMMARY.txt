  FIX COMPLETED: Add Subject & Add Category Buttons Now Working
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DATE: January 9, 2025

PROBLEM:
--------
✗ "Add Subject" button was unresponsive (no modal appeared)
✗ "Add Category" button was unresponsive (no modal appeared)

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
The Modal component requires an "isOpen" prop to render, but we were 
using conditional rendering without passing this prop. This caused the
modal to always return null.

SOLUTION:
---------
Updated modal usage to properly pass required props:
  - isOpen={showSubjectModal}
  - onClose={() => setShowSubjectModal(false)}
  - title="Create New Subject"
  - size="md"

CHANGES:
--------
✓ Fixed Add Subject modal (lines 2785-2815)
✓ Fixed Add Question Category modal (lines 2945-2996)
✓ Build successful with no errors
✓ Development server restarted

WHAT TO DO NOW:
---------------
1. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R) to clear cache
3. Log in as admin
4. Navigate to Subjects tab
5. Click "Add Subject" button → Modal should appear!
6. Navigate to Questions tab, select a subject
7. Click "Add Category" button → Modal should appear!

TESTING CHECKLIST:
------------------
□ Modal opens when clicking "Add Subject"
□ Modal opens when clicking "Add Category"
□ Modal closes when clicking overlay
□ Modal closes when pressing ESC key
□ Form fields are visible and functional
□ Forms submit and create items successfully

FILES MODIFIED:
