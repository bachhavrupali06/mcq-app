╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

PROBLEM:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
All delete buttons in the admin dashboard were non-functional:
  ❌ Exams - Delete button didn't work
  ❌ Subjects - Delete button didn't work  
  ❌ Categories - Delete button didn't work
  ❌ Questions - Delete button didn't work
  ❌ Question Categories - Delete button didn't work
  ❌ API Keys - Delete button didn't work

ROOT CAUSE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Missing Delete Confirmation Modal component in the JSX.

The backend logic was perfect:
  ✓ handleDeleteConfirm() function existed
  ✓ openDeleteConfirm() function existed
  ✓ State variables existed
  ✓ All delete buttons properly wired
  ✓ All API endpoints working
  
BUT: No UI modal to display the confirmation dialog!

SOLUTION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Added a comprehensive Delete Confirmation Modal at line 3661 in AdminDashboard.js

FILE CHANGED:
  📄 client/src/components/AdminDashboard.js
  📍 Lines: 3661-3750 (92 new lines)

MODAL FEATURES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
